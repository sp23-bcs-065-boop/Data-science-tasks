# Deforestation & CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Analysis

## üìÑ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global deforestation and CO‚ÇÇ emissions data to understand environmental trends, loss of forest cover, and the impact on carbon emissions. The datasets used provide country-wise annual statistics for forest area, forest loss, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions.  

The analysis includes:  
- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Handling duplicates and missing values  
- Preparing the data for visualization and further analysis

## üóÇÔ∏è Datasets

### 1. Deforestation Dataset
- **Columns include**: `Country`, `Year`, `Forest Area (ha)`, `Forest Loss (ha)`, `Forest Gain (ha)`  
- **Source**: Global Forest Watch  
- **Purpose**: To track forest cover changes over the years  

### 2. CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Dataset
- **Columns include**: `Country`, `Year`, `CO2 Emissions (metric tons)`  
- **Source**: Global Carbon Project  
- **Purpose**: To track annual CO‚ÇÇ emissions by country

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation

The following steps were applied to ensure high-quality data:

1. **Remove duplicate records**  
   - Ensured that each `Country-Year` pair is unique  

2. **Handle missing or small country data**  
   - Imputed missing values where necessary or removed insignificant rows to avoid analysis bias  

3. **Standardize column names**  
   - Ensured consistent naming for easier data manipulation  

4. **Type conversion**  
   - Converted numeric fields from text to numeric type for calculations  

5. **Output cleaned datasets**  
   - Saved as CSV for reproducibility  

**Libraries used**: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readxl` (R)

## üîç Example Code Snippet (R)
```r
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readxl)

# Load dataset
deforestation <- read_excel(file.choose())
co2 <- read_excel(file.choose())

# Remove duplicate country-year records
deforestation_clean <- deforestation %>%
    distinct(Country, Year, .keep_all = TRUE)

co2_clean <- co2 %>%
    distinct(Country, Year, .keep_all = TRUE)

# Handle missing values
deforestation_clean <- deforestation_clean %>%
    drop_na()

co2_clean <- co2_clean %>%
    drop_na()

# Save cleaned data
write.csv(deforestation_clean, "deforestation_clean.csv", row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(co2_clean, "co2_clean.csv", row.names = FALSE)
